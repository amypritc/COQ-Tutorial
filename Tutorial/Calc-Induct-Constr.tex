The reference manual for the Calculus of Inductive Constructions used by Coq can be found here:

This gives things such as typing rules, conversion rules, subtyping rules, inductive definitions, etc., 
used by Coq.

This is useful if you'd like a more in-depth perspective on the formal definitions and intuition behind 
the typing system in Coq - but it is not necessary to know or understand these definitions in great 
detail to have Coq be of use to you.

This will not be discussed further in this tutorial to keep things simple. 
Please see the website given above if this is of interest to you.
