This example defines a recursive function that takes a number n and returns the sum of the numbers from one to n (i.e., \TT{$\Sigma_{i = 0}^n\ i$}).
It then proves that for all nat numbers, 2 * sum n = (1 + n) * n.
This assertion is equivalent to sum n = ((1 + n) * n) / 2; 
however, it is much easier to prove when we do not involve division.
First, a longer proof using properties of addition and multiplication will be shown, 
then the shorter version that applies the ring tactic to take care of the application of many of these properties for us.

\begin{code}
	\Load \nm{Arith}.
	\\ \\
	\Fixpoint \nm{sum} (n : nat) : nat := 		\\ \-\ \quad
	\match n \with						\\ \-\ \quad
	$\mid$ O $=>$ 0					\\ \-\ \quad
	$\mid$ S p $=>$ (S p) + (sum p)		\\ \-\ \quad
	\End.
\end{code}

\noindent
In this example, we will use functional induction to help us successfully complete our proof over the recursive function sum.
To do this, we must first make sure to require and load FunInd, and then define the functional induction scheme.
