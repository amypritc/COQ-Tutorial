\subsection{Assertions} \label{assertions}
To switch on the proof environment, you first need to use one of the keywords for an assertion. It does not matter which one you choose, all have the same behavior - it is more a matter of personal preference. 

\noindent
These keywords are: 

Theorem,
Lemma,
Corollary,
Proposition,
Fact,
Goal,
Example, 
Remark
\\ \\
\noindent
After using one of the keywords, you will give your assertion a name, followed by a semi-colon, then write out the body of your assertion, followed by a period. 

\noindent
The theorem template (Templates tab $\to$ Theorem) is shown below:
\begin{code}
	\Theorem \nm{new\_theorem} : .	\\
	\Proof.
	\\ \\
	\Qed.
\end{code}


\subsection{Proof Environment Commands} \label{proof_env_cmd}

\begin{tabular}{l L}
\Proof. &
	Begins the proof.
\\ \\
\Qed. &
	Ends and saves the proof; will fail if the assertion is not fully proven.
\\ \\
\Admitted. &
	Gives up the current proof; declares the initial goal as an axiom that can be used in other proofs (but will need to be fully proven later).
\\ \\
\Abort. &
	Cancels the current proof development.
\end{tabular}
