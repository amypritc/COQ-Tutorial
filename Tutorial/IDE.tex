\subsection{Script Buffer}
Here you can type out new definitions and proofs in a new buffer, or open a buffer from a saved file by going to the File tab $\to$ Open, then choosing the file. 
You can edit and save new and existing buffers here. 
\begin{code}

\subsection{Goal Window}
Goals to be proven will be displayed here. 
This window will be empty unless you're in a proof environment; inside the proof environment, it will display what you goal are currently proving, what goals are left to be proved, or that there are no more subgoals and your proof is complete.
\begin{goal} 
	This block represents the goal window in this tutorial. 
\end{goal}



\subsection{Message Window}
Any messages resulting from an executed command will be displayed here. 
Results from queries are also printed out here. 
Clicking the arrow in the corner of the Messages, Errors, or Jobs tab here will create a separate window for that tab. 
When the separate window is closed, it will return to the main Coq IDE window.
